<h2>WeensyOS Minilab 1</h2>

<p class="exercise">Keep in mind that this is individual work only—no groups. (You can share ideas but not code.)
</p>

<p>The WeensyOS problem sets are a series of little coding exercises that
are also complete operating systems.

You could boot a WeensyOS operating system on real x86-compatible hardware!

The purpose of the WeensyOS exercises is first, to teach some of the
concepts we use in class through example, and second, to demystify
operating systems in general.

I also hope they are fun.</p>


<p>The first WeensyOS problem set concerns <i>processes</i>.

The MiniprocOS is a tiny operating system that supports the major process
primitives: creating a new process with <code>fork</code>, exiting a
process, and waiting on a process that has exited.

The only thing missing -- and it's a big one -- is process isolation:
MiniprocOS processes actually share a single address space.  (In a later
minilab you will implement process isolation for memory.)

In this problem set, you will actually implement the code that forks a
new process, and see how system calls are implemented.

You will also update the code that waits on an exited process to avoid busy
waiting.</p>


<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tbody><tr><td><b><code>weensyos1.tar.gz</code></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Source code for WeensyOS 1, which builds this hard
    disk image:</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>mpos.img</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>MiniprocOS, plus two applications that create and run new processes.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In this simple problem set, you'll browse, partially understand, and
change this tiny operating system.</p>



<h3>Handing in</h3>

<p>You will electronically hand in code and a small writeup
containing answers to the numbered exercises.

The problem set code, <code>weensyos1.tar.gz</code>
(available on CourseWeb),
unpacks into a directory called <code>weensyos1</code>.  (We explain how to unpack it
below.)

You'll modify the code in this directory, and add a text file with your
answers to the numbered exercises.

When you're done, run the command <code class="type">make tarball</code>.

This should create a file named
<code>weensyos1-<i>yourusername</i>.tar.gz</code>.

You'll turn in this file to CourseWeb.</p>

<p><b>Answer the numbered exercises</b> by editing the file named
<code>answers.txt</code>.

<i>No Microsoft Word documents</i> (or other binary format such as PDF) <i>will be accepted!</i>

For coding exercises, it's OK for <code>answers.txt</code> to just refer to
your code (as long as you comment your code).</p>


<p>To review:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <code>weensyos1.tar.gz</code> and unpack it.</li>
<li>Do your work in the <code>weensyos1</code> directory.</li>
<li>Fill out the
<code>answers.txt</code> file in that directory.</li>
<li>When you're done, run <code class="type">make tarball</code> from the <code>weensyos1</code> directory.  This will create a file named <code>weensyos1-<i>yourusername</i>.tar.gz</code>.</li>
<li>Submit that <code>weensyos1-<i>yourusername</i>.tar.gz</code> file to
CourseWeb.</li> </ol>



<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>You could take one of the disk image files this minilab builds, write it
to your laptop's hard drive, and boot up your operating system directly if
you wanted!

However, it's much easier to work with a <i>virtual</i> machine or <i>PC
emulator</i>.</p>


<p>An emulator mimics, or <i>emulates</i>, the behavior of a full hardware
platform.

A PC emulator acts like a Pentium-class PC: it emulates the
execution of Intel x86 instructions, and the behavior of other PC
hardware.  For example, it can treat a normal file in your home directory
as an emulated hard disk; when the program inside the emulator reads a
sector from the disk, the emulator simply reads 512 bytes from the file.

PC emulators are much slower than real hardware, since they do all of the
regular CPU's job in software -- not to mention the disk controller's job,
the console's job, and so forth.

However, debugging with an emulator is a whole lot friendlier, and you
can't screw up your machine!</p>


<p>We've used two PC emulators.  The <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/"><b>Bochs</b></a> emulator has pretty
nice debugging support.  The <a href="http://www.qemu.org/"><b>QEMU</b></a> package is fast
and sleek, but it might be <i>too</i> fast for some of our purposes.

You will also need a copy of GCC that compiles code for an x86 ELF
target.

<!-- ELF, or Executable and Linkable Format, is a particular format for storing
machine language programs on disk. -->

Recent Linux PCs have the right compiler already set up.

<!-- However, if you want to work on other platforms, or on Windows, you'll
need a <i>cross-compiler</i>: a version of GCC that runs on your machine,
but generates binaries for WeensyOS. --></p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you use the
<a href="http://read.cs.ucla.edu/111/labsetup">CS 111 Ubuntu Distribution</a>
if you want to work from home.

We've set up all the required tools on the machines in the Linux lab, and
the SEASnet Linux servers.  In the Linux lab, no special setup is
required. <a href="http://www.read.seas.harvard.edu/~kohler/class/07f-osp/tools.html">Here</a> you may find some more information with regard to setting up the right environment.</p>

<p>Now that you've got all the software set up (or you've just decided to
use the Linux lab), it's time to download WeensyOS and take it out for a
spin.</p>

<p class="exercise">Unpack the source for weensyos1 using the
following command.</p>

<!-- <p>If you've never unpacked source code before, don't worry; the process is
very easy.  Unix source code is distributed in packed files
informally called <i>tarballs</i>, after the <i>tar</i> (<b>T</b>ape
<b>AR</b>chive) program that parses the format.  Think of a tarball as a
Zip archive: a single file that contains compressed versions of a set of
other files.  Tarballs have the suffix <tt>.tar</tt> or, more frequently,
<tt>.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>.tgz</tt>.  These latter suffixes indicate that the
tarball has been <i>compressed</i>.  The GNU <i>tar</i> program knows how
to uncompress the tarball and extract all its comments.  Here's the
command:</p> -->

<pre class="samp">% <span class="type">tar xzf weensyos1.tar.gz</span>
</pre>

<p>(On Linux, you can just say "<span class="type">tar xzf
weensyos1.tar.gz</span>".)  This should unpack the tarball into the
<tt>weensyos1</tt> directory.</p>

<pre class="samp">% <span class="type">ls weensyos1</span>
COPYRIGHT    conf   mergedep.pl   mpos-app2.c  mpos-kern.h      mpos.h
GNUmakefile  elf.h  mkbootdisk.c  mpos-boot.c  mpos-loader.c    types.h
answers.txt  lib.c  mpos-app.c    mpos-int.S   mpos-symbols.ld  x86.h
bootstart.S  lib.h  mpos-app.h    mpos-kern.c  mpos-x86.c
%
</pre>

<p>Now that you've unpacked the source, it's time to give the OSes a
whirl.</p>

<p class="exercise"> Change into the <tt>weensyos1</tt> directory and run
the <tt class="type">make</tt> program (which must be GNU make).</p>

<!-- <div class='note'><p>The <tt>make</tt> program should work immediately if
you are doing this lib in the Linux lab, or on your own recent x86
machine.</p>

<p>You may also log in to the Solaris machines, although this takes a bit
more work.  Since Bochs puts up a GUI, you must either use a terminal or
<code class='type'>ssh -X</code>.  Once logged in, simply add the
<code>/u/cs/class/cs111/cbin/bin</code> directory to your PATH environment
variable, using one of these commands:</p>

<pre class='samp'>
# In csh-like shells (this includes the default):
% <span class='type'>setenv PATH /u/cs/class/cs111/cbin/bin:$PATH</span>

# In bash-like shells (this includes the default):
$ <span class='type'>export PATH=/u/cs/class/cs111/cbin/bin:$PATH</span>
</pre>
</p>
</div> -->

<!-- <p><tt>make</tt>, in case you haven't heard of it, is one of a family of
<i><tt>make</tt></i> programs that simplify the process of building
software projects.

The user writes a set of rules, called a <i>Makefile</i>, that tells the
<tt>make</tt> program what to build.

For example, a Makefile might say, "to compile a C program, run the
<tt>gcc</tt> compiler; and by the way, I want to compile the program named
<tt>hello</tt>, which depends on the C source file <tt>hello.c</tt>".

Makefiles can be quite simple, although most medium-to-large projects have
complex Makefiles.

You'll be using a couple simple Makefiles in the labs.</p> -->

<p>The WeensyOS <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> builds a hard disk
image called <tt>mpos.img</tt>, which contains the MiniprocOS "kernel"
and two applications, <tt>mpos-app.c</tt> and <tt>mpos-app2.c</tt>.</p>


<p>Make's output should look something like this:</p>

<pre class="samp">% <span class="type">make</span>
+ hostcc mkbootdisk.c
+ as bootstart.S
+ cc mpos-boot.c
+ ld mpos-bootsector
+ as mpos-int.S
+ cc mpos-kern.c
+ cc mpos-x86.c
+ cc mpos-loader.c
+ cc lib.c
+ cc mpos-app.c
+ ld mpos-app
+ cc mpos-app2.c
+ ld mpos-app2
+ ld mpos-kern
+ mk mpos.img
%
</pre>

<p>Now that you've built the OS disk image, it's time to run it!  We've
made it very easy to boot a given disk image; just run this command:</p>

<pre class="samp">% <span class="type">make run-mpos</span>
</pre>

<p>This will start up Bochs.  After a moment you should see a window like
this!</p>

<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos0.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS]" align="middle" border="1">

<p>Hit "<code>1</code>" to try to run the first application, and you should see a window like this:</p>

<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos1.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS]" align="middle" border="1">

<p>To quit Bochs, click the "Power" button in the upper-right corner.
(Very funny, Bochs.)</p>

<p><b>QEMU Note.</b> If you're running QEMU instead of Bochs, run the
MiniprocOS with <span class="type">qemu -hda mpos.img</span>.  (The
<code>-hda</code> option stands for Hard Disk A.)  QEMU doesn't have a
funky power button; just hit Control-C in the terminal to quit.  QEMU will
sometimes "grab" the keyboard, which prevents you from doing anything else.
If you appear to have lost control of your computer, check QEMU's title
bar: it may say something like "Press Ctrl-Alt to exit grab".  Press
Ctrl-Alt and things should return to normal.</p>


<h3>MiniprocOS Application</h3>

<p>You're now ready to start learning about the OS code!</p>

<p>Start first with the application, <tt>mpos-app.c</tt>.  This
application simply starts a single child process and waits for it to exit.
It uses system calls that implement the process functions we discussed in
class: <tt>fork</tt> starts a new process;
<tt>exit</tt> exits a process; and <tt>wait</tt> returns a process's exit
status.</p>

<p class="exercise">Read and understand the code in
<tt>mpos-app.c</tt>.</p>


<p>How are those system calls implemented?

As discussed in class, to call a system call, the application program
executes a <i>trap</i>: an instruction that initiates a protected control
transfer to the kernel.

The system call's arguments are often stored in machine registers, and
that's how MiniprocOS does it.

Likewise, the system call's results are often returned in a machine
register.

On Intel 80386-compatible machines (colloquially called "x86es"), the
interrupt instruction is called <code>int</code>, and registers have names
like <code>%eax</code>, <code>%ebx</code>, and so forth.

A special C language statement, called <code>asm</code>, can execute the
interrupt instruction and connect register values with C-language
variables.</p>


<p class="exercise">Read and understand the comments in
<tt>mpos-app.h</tt>.

This file defines MiniprocOS's system calls.

Also glance through the code, to see how system calls actually work!</p>


<p>The MiniprocOS <i>kernel</i> handles these system calls.</p>

<p class="note">

This kernel is different from conventional operating system kernels in
several ways, mostly to keep the kernel as small as possible.

For one thing, the kernel shares an address space with user applications,
so that user applications could write over the kernel if they wanted to.

This isn't very <i>robust</i>, since the kernel is not isolated from user
faults, but for now it is easier to keep everything in the same address
space.

Another difference is that MiniprocOS implements <i>cooperative
multitasking</i>, rather than <i>preemptive multitasking</i>.

That is, processes give up control <i>voluntarily</i>, and if a process went
into an infinite loop, the machine would entirely stop.

In preemptive multitasking, the kernel can <em>preempt</em> an
uncooperative process, which forces it to give up control.

Preemptive multitasking is more robust than cooperative multitasking,
meaning it's more resilient to errors, but it is slightly more complex.
All modern PC-class operating systems use preemptive multitasking for
user-level applications, but the kernel itself usually switches between
internal tasks using cooperative multitasking.</p>


<p>MiniprocOS's main kernel structures are as follows.</p>

<dl>

<dt><b><code>struct process_t</code></b></dt>
<dd>This is the <i>process descriptor</i> structure, which stores all the
relevant information for each process.  It is defined in
<tt>mpos-kern.h</tt>.</dd>

<dt><b><code>process_t miniproc[];</code></b></dt>
<dd>This is an array of process descriptor structures, one for each possible
process.  MiniprocOS supports up to 15 concurrent processes, with process IDs 1
to 15.  The process descriptor for process <i><code>I</code></i> is stored in
<code>miniproc[<i>I</i>]</code>.  Initially, only one of these processes is
active, namely <code>miniproc[1]</code>.  The <code>miniproc[0]</code> entry
is never used.</dd>

<dt><b><code>process_t *current;</code></b></dt>
<dd>This points to the process descriptor for the currently running
process.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The code in <tt>mpos-kern.c</tt> sets up these structures.  In
particular, the <code>start()</code> function initializes all the process
descriptors.</p>

<p class="exercise">Read and understand the code and comments in
<tt>mpos-kern.h</tt>.  Then read and understand the memory map in
<tt>mpos-kern.c</tt>, the picture at the top that explains how MiniprocOS's
memory is laid out.  Then look at <code>start()</code>.</p>


<p>The code you'll be changing in MiniprocOS is the function that responds to
system calls.  This function is called <code>interrupt()</code>.</p>

<p class="exercise">Read and understand the code for
<code>interrupt()</code> in <tt>mpos-kern.c</tt>.  Concentrate on the
simplest system call, namely <code>sys_getpid/INT_SYS_GETPID</code>.
Understand how the <code>sys_getpid</code> application function (in
<tt>mpos-app.h</tt>) and the <code>INT_SYS_GETPID</code> clause in
<code>interrupt()</code> (in <tt>mpos-kern.c</tt>) interact.</p>


<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 1.</b> Answer the following question: Say
you replaced <code>run(current)</code> in the
<code>INT_SYS_GETPID</code> clause with <code>schedule()</code>.
The process that called <code>sys_getpid()</code> will eventually run
again, picking up its execution as if <code>sys_getpid()</code> had returned
directly.  When it does run, will the <code>sys_getpid()</code> call have
returned the correct value?</p>


<p>You may have noticed, though, that the <code>sys_fork()</code>
system call isn't working!  Your job is to write the code that actually
creates a new process.</p>


<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 2.</b> Fill out the <code>do_fork()</code>
and <code>copy_stack()</code> functions in <tt>mpos-kern.c</tt>.</p>


<p>Congratulations, you've written code to create a process -- it's not
that hard, no?  (Our version is less than 20 lines of code.)  Here's what
you should see when you're done:</p>


<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos2.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS after Exercise 2]" align="middle">


<p>Now take a look at the code in <code>mpos-app.c</code> that calls
<code>sys_wait()</code>.  Also look at the <code>INT_SYS_WAIT</code>
implementation in <code>mpos-kern.c</code>.  The current system call design
uses a <em>polling</em> approach: to wait for process 2 to exit, a process
must call <code>sys_wait(2)</code> over and over again until process 2
exits and the <code>sys_wait(2)</code> system call returns a value
different from <code>WAIT_TRYAGAIN</code>.</p>

<p>We'll see more about polling later in the quarter, but for now, notice
that polling approaches like this often reduce <em>utilization</em>.  A
process uses CPU time to call <code>sys_wait(2)</code> over and over again,
leaving less CPU time for others.  An alternative approach, which can
improve utilization, is called <em>blocking</em>.  A blocking
implementation would put <code>sys_wait(2)</code>'s caller to sleep, then
wake it up once process 2 had exited and a real exit status was available.
The sleeping process doesn't use any CPU.  A process that is asleep because
the kernel is waiting for some event is called <em>blocked</em>.</p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Exercise 3.</b> Change the implementation of
<code>INT_SYS_WAIT</code> in <code>mpos-kern.c</code> to use blocking
instead of polling.  In particular, when the caller tries to wait on a
process that has not yet exited, that process should block until the
process actually exits.

<p></p>

<strong>Important Hint:</strong> Make sure that your blocking version of
<code>sys_wait()</code> has <em>exactly the same</em> user-visible behavior
as the original version, except that it blocks and so never returns
<code>-2</code>.  See <code>mpos-app.h</code> for an English description of
the current behavior.
</div>

<p>To implement Exercise 3, you will probably want to add a field to the
process descriptor structure.

This field will indicate whether or not a process is waiting on another
process.

You will change <code>INT_SYS_WAIT</code> to add the calling process to
this "wait queue", and <code>INT_SYS_EXIT</code> to wake any processes
that were on the "wait queue".

There are several ways to do this; describe how you did it in
<tt>answers.txt</tt>.</p>

<p>To check your work, try changing the <code>sys_wait()</code> loop in
<code>mpos-app.c</code> to look like this:

</p><pre class="samp">		do {
			status = sys_wait(p);
			<strong>app_printf("W");</strong>
		} while (status == WAIT_TRYAGAIN);
</pre>

<p>A polling implementation of <code>sys_wait</code> would produce output
like this:</p>

<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos2a.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS 2 before Exercise 3]" align="middle">

<p>You want it to produce output like this:</p>

<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos2b.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS 2 after Exercise 3]" align="middle">


<h3>Cleaning Up Processes</h3>

<p>Now try running the other MiniprocOS application.  You should see
something like this (different processes generally print their lines in
different colors):</p>


<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos3.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS 2 after Exercise 3]" align="middle">


<p>The MiniprocOS2 application, in <code>mpos-app2.c</code>, tries to run
1024 child processes.</p>

<p class="exercise">Read and understand <code>mpos-app2.c</code>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, your current kernel code doesn't seem able to run more
than 15 total processes, ever!

It looks like old, dead processes aren't being cleaned up, even after we call
<code>sys_wait()</code> on them.

This is what we call a bug.</p>


<p class="exercise"><b>Exercise 4.</b> Find and fix this bug.</p>


<p>When you've completed this exercise, the application should count up to
1024, like this:</p>


<img src="./minilab1_files/fig-mpos4.gif" alt="[MiniprocOS 2 after Exercise 4]" align="middle">


<p>Your colors may differ, however, depending on how you implement
<code>sys_wait()</code>.  One common implementation strategy ends with
several red lines in a row.  If you see this in your code, try to figure
out why!</p>


<p><b>This completes the minilab.</b> But here are some extra credit
opportunities, if you're interested.</p>


<div class="exercise"><b>Extra-Credit Exercise 5.</b> Our version of
<code>sys_fork()</code>, with its dirt simple stack copying strategy, works
only for simple programs.  For example, consider the following function
definition:

<pre class="samp">void start(void) {
        int x = 0;  /* note that local variable x lives on the stack */
        /* YOUR CODE HERE */
        pid_t p = sys_fork();
        if (p == 0)
                /* YOUR CODE HERE */;
        else if (p &gt; 0)
                sys_wait(p); // assume blocking implementation
        app_printf("%d", x);
        sys_exit(0);
}
</pre>

In a system with true process isolation, the child process's <code>x</code>
and the parent process's <code>x</code> would be different variables, and
changes in one process would not affect the other's <code>x</code>.  But in
MiniprocOS, this is not always the case!  For this exercise, produce a
version of that code with the following properties:

<ol>
<li>The code uses only local variables.</li>
<li>In a system with correct process isolation, the code would print
"<code>10</code>".</li>
<li>In MiniprocOS, the code would print "<code>11</code>".</li>
</ol>

<strong>Hint:</strong> It isn't easy to get this to work because the
compiler tends to optimize away important assignment statements or shift
them to unfortunate places.  Mark a variable as <code>volatile</code> to
tell the compiler not to optimize references to it.  Doing this correctly
is tricky, but if you can understand the difference between <code>volatile
int *x</code> and <code>int * volatile x</code> you can do this problem.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="exercise"><b>Extra-Credit Exercise 6.</b> MiniprocOS
miniprocesses have some aspects of threads.  For instance, like threads,
they all share a single address space.  A big difference from threads is
that we create a new process by forking.  New threads are created in a
different way.  Introduce a new system call,

<pre class="samp">pid_t sys_newthread(void (*start_function)(void));
</pre>

that creates a new process in a thread-like way.  The new process should
start with an <em>empty</em> stack, not a copy of the current stack.
Rather than starting at the same instruction as the parent, the new thread
should start by executing the <code>start_function</code> function: that
is, that function's address becomes the new thread's instruction
pointer.</div>

<p class="exercise"><b>Extra-Credit Exercise 7.</b> Introduce a
<code>sys_kill(<i>pid</i>)</code> system call by which one process can make
another process exit.  Use this system call to alter <tt>mpos-app2.c</tt>'s
<code>run_child()</code> function so that the even-numbered processes kill
off all odd-numbered processes (except for thread 1).  Running the
application should print out "<tt>Process N lives</tt>" messages only for
even-numbered values of <tt>N</tt>.</p>
